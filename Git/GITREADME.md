# Git Learning README 
- This README document will contain what i have learned about git today and it will explain my understanding of it 

## What is Git?

1. Git is a tool that helps track changes in files, especially code files. It’s mainly used by developers to manage projects and keep a history of all changes.

    * Git is a version control system, which means it keeps track of every change made to files in a project.

    * It helps manage changes so you can go back to previous versions if needed.

    



    ## What are Repositories?


A repository (or repo) is like a folder where Git tracks changes to your files. There are two main types of repositories:

- **Local Repository**: This is the repository on your computer.
- **Remote Repository**: This is the repository stored on a platform like GitHub so others can access it.

A repository is where all your project’s files and the history of changes are stored.
