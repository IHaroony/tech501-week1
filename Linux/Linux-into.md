### **Key Concepts in Linux**

1. **File System**:
    
    - Everything in Linux is a file, organized in a tree-like structure.
    - The root directory is `/`, with subdirectories like `/home`, `/etc`, `/var`, etc.
    - Your personal files are usually located in `/home/<your-username>`.
2. **Case Sensitivity**:
    
    - Linux is case-sensitive. For example, `File.txt` and `file.txt` are different.
3. **Permissions**:
    
    - Linux enforces strict file permissions for security. Each file has an **owner**, a **group**, and **access levels** (read, write, execute).
4. **The Command Line**:
    
    - The terminal is where you type commands to interact with the system.
