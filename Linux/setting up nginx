 **Process of Nginx Web Server 
### **Objective:**

- Set up a basic Nginx web server on an Azure VM.
- Replace the default Nginx webpage with a custom HTML page.
- Download an image to the VM.
- Display the downloaded image on the custom webpage.

---

### **1. SSH Login to the Azure VM**

Start by logging into your Azure VM using SSH:

1. Open the terminal 
2. Use the following command to log into the VM (replace `tech501-haroon-az-key` with your actual private key, and `172.187.169.222` with your VM's public IP):


`ssh -i tech501-haroon-az-key adminuser@172.187.169.222`

Where:

- `-i tech501-haroon-az-key`: Specifies the SSH key used for authentication.
- `adminuser`: The username for your VM.
- `172.187.169.222`: The public IP address of your VM.

---

### **2. Install Nginx on the VM**

Once logged in, check if Nginx is already installed, or install it if needed:

#### **Check if Nginx is installed:**

Run the following command to see if Nginx is installed:



`sudo systemctl is-enabled nginx`

If Nginx is not installed, you’ll get an output saying it’s not found, and you can proceed to install it.

#### **Install Nginx:**

Run these commands to install Nginx:

1. **Update the package list**:
    
    
    sudo apt upgrade -y
    `sudo apt update`
    
2. **Install Nginx**:
    
    
    `sudo apt install nginx`
    
3. **Start Nginx**:
    

    
    `sudo systemctl start nginx`
    
4. **Enable Nginx to start on boot**:
    
    
    
    `sudo systemctl enable nginx`

### **3. Replace the Default Nginx Webpage**

After installing Nginx, you’ll want to replace the default webpage with your custom HTML page.

#### **Navigate to Nginx's Default HTML Directory:**

The default webpage for Nginx is stored in `/var/www/html`. Navigate there:


`cd /var/www/html`

#### **Backup the Default Webpage 

To keep a backup of the default `index.html`, run:

`sudo mv index.html index.html.bak`

#### **Create a Custom HTML Page:**

Create a new `index.html` file in the `/var/www/html` directory:



`sudo nano index.html`

Add your custom HTML content, like this:

html



`<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head>     <title>Haroon's Webpage</title> </head> <body>     <h1>Welcome to My Custom Webpage!</h1>     <br>     <p>This is my webpage running on Nginx.</p>     <img src="mountain-countryside-landscape-at-sunset-dramatic-sky-over-a-distant-valley-green-fields-and-trees-on-hill-beautiful-natural-landscapes-of-the-carpathians-generative-ai-variation-8-photo.jpeg" alt="My Image" width="600"> </body> </html>`

Save and exit the file editor (`Ctrl + O` to save, `Ctrl + X` to exit).

---

### **4. Download an Image to the VM**

Next, download the image you want to display on your webpage to the VM.

1. **Download the Image** using `wget`:
    
    Run the following command to download the image from the URL:
    
  
    
    `wget https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/024/669/482/non_2x/mountain-countryside-landscape-at-sunset-dramatic-sky-over-a-distant-valley-green-fields-and-trees-on-hill-beautiful-natural-landscapes-of-the-carpathians-generative-ai-variation-8-photo.jpeg`
    
    This will download the image to the current directory on your VM.
    
2. **Move the Image to the Correct Directory**:
    
    After the image is downloaded, move it to the `/var/www/html` directory so that Nginx can serve it:
    
    
    `sudo mv mountain-countryside-landscape-at-sunset-dramatic-sky-over-a-distant-valley-green-fields-and-trees-on-hill-beautiful-natural-landscapes-of-the-carpathians-generative-ai-variation-8-photo.jpeg /var/www/html/`
    

---

### **5. Verify and Test the Webpage**

#### **Access the Webpage in a Browser:**

1. Open a web browser and visit your VM’s public IP address (`http://172.187.169.222`).
2. You should see your custom webpage with the image displayed.

#### **Troubleshooting**:

- If the webpage does not show the image, double-check that the `src` in the `<img>` tag matches the filename of the image you downloaded and moved to `/var/www/html`.

### **Task Summary**

Here’s a recap of what was done:

1. **Logged into the Azure VM** via SSH.
2. **Installed Nginx** and verified it was enabled to start on boot.
3. **Created a custom HTML page** to replace the default Nginx page.
4. **Downloaded an image** to the VM and moved it to the Nginx web directory.
5. **Updated the HTML page** to include the image.
6. **Verified the webpage** by visiting the VM's public IP in the browser.

---

### **Final Remarks:**

 successfully configured Nginx on your Azure VM, replaced the default webpage with a custom page, and added an image to it.
