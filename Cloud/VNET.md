### **What is a Virtual Network (VNet) in Cloud?**



A **Virtual Network (VNet)** is a private, isolated network within a cloud environment that allows resources (like virtual machines, databases, and storage) to communicate securely with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

### **Key Concepts of VNet**

1. **Purpose**:
    
    - Acts like your own private network but hosted in the cloud.
    - Ensures secure communication between resources.
2. **IP Address Range**:
    
    - You define the range of IP addresses using **CIDR (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)**.
    - This range determines how many IPs are available for your resources.
3. **Subnets**:
    
    - VNet is divided into smaller **subnets** to organize resources.
    - Example:
        - **Public Subnet**: Resources can access the internet.
        - **Private Subnet**: Resources cannot access the internet directly (e.g., databases).
4. **Communication**:
    
    - Resources in the same VNet can talk to each other.
    - You can connect a VNet to:
        - The internet (via a gateway).
        - Other VNets (via peering).
        - On-premises networks (via VPN or ExpressRoute).

### **Why VNets Are Useful**

- **Security**: Isolates your resources and controls access using firewalls or Network Security Groups (NSGs).
- **Scalability**: Allows you to add resources like VMs, containers, or databases on demand.
- **Flexibility**: You control how resources communicate within and outside the network.

### **Real-World Example of a VNet**

Imagine hosting a website in the cloud:

- **Public Subnet**: Contains the web server VM, which needs internet access.
- **Private Subnet**: Contains a database that only the web server can access.

### **Diagram Overview**

**VNet**

- **CIDR**: 10.0.0.0/16
    - **Public Subnet**: 10.0.1.0/24 (Web server with internet access).
    - **Private Subnet**: 10.0.2.0/24 (Database with no internet access).
